# Yundi Jude Zhu's Final Project: Face Pong
### IDM Spring 2019 Creative Coding
 
"Face Pong" is an AR Pong Game that can turn any same-color object into virtual paddels to hit the ball. 
 
 * Use the mouse to click on the object and the program will start color tracking and draw rectangles. 
 * Move your object to hit the ball to score.
 * The higher the score is, the faster the ball moves.
 * Press "s" to save a screenshot.
 * Press "r" to reset the ball's position, in case it's stuck somewhere. This function is also used to test what happens when the score reaches 100, 300, 500, 1000.

For this final project, I extend the computer vision I've been exploring since my midterm project--AR Spongebob Selfie Prototype.

I customized functions to make the ball move and generate smoke after collision. I also used Array and ArrayList to make multiple paddles and smoke effects. I used video as my main media for AR and computer vision. The program can also export screenshots when press the "s" button.

The meaning of this interactive program is not about getting higher scores, but to try out the AR function by turning anything into a human-computer interaction tool. I want people to make funny movements and take interesting screenshots while playing around with the ball.

Have fun!
