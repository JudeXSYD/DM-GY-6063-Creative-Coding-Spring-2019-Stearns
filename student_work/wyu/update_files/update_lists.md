Dear Professor Stearns,

Please have a look at the following journals. I've made some changes and would like you to adjust my grade based on these updates:

I added the journals of week01 and week06 and week07,now there are a total of 28 entries (2 for each week we met for class). 
And I fixed the images problems of week04 and week05.
Also I updated the journals of week03


I also updated my challenges of the week05 and week 06, now I have 3 challenges of the week05 and 3 challenges of the week06. 
Total 9 challenges for week05, 4 projects for challenge01, 2 for challenge02(combined the step 2,3,3 into a project), 3 for challenge02.
Total 3 challenges for week06.

Thank you for your reviewing.
